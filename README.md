# Python_For_Leetcode
A Quick Start to Python for LeetCode Problems

Python coding much faster compared to Java and C++. However, the examination time for Online Assessments remains the same regardless of which programming language the programmers use.
This is unfair for programmers who using Java and C++. This is a quick Python tutorial aimed at helping programmers quickly acquire the knowledge needed to solve problems using Python.

The goal of this project is to help individuals with backgrounds in other programming languages (Java, C++, etc.) quickly acquire the knowledge required to solve LeetCode problems using Python within 2-3 days
